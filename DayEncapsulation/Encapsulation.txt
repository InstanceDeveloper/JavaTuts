Encapsulation:
	-The process of binding properties and behaviours
	-The process of binding code as a single unit is called 
	 Encapsulation. 

	 Ex: 
	- Class is the best example of encapsulation.
	- Package is binding group of class required tasks as 
	  group

	-Tight Encapsulation:
		A class with private properties is called Tightly encapsulated class.

	JavaBean Class - It contains private properties and public setters and getters methods.

	getters and setters are user defined classes not pre-defined classes.
	we are defining the methods to set data and get data.
